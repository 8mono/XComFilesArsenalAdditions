# XComFilesArsenalAdditions' Workshop
 Submod for Solarius Scorch's X-Com Files mod!
Workshop edition! All the new features im testing will be here, before anything is stable or finalized it will have to stay here. You can still report any bugs you find, but it will most likely come from the unfinished nature of things here.

- Currently making - 
Anti E-115: Damage type that can nullify a lot of the special effects the new Chryssalids and Zombies have, sets them on fire as well. Harmless to most other life forms. Most of the creatures here can also have their effects nullified by incendiary, but they must be at half HP or lower. Additionally incendiary might not stop regeneration, Anti E-115 will and will work at any HP level, and is even able to cause fatal wounds. Anti-E115 and Incendiary when used on units carrying eggs or similar stuff will cause them to be "deactivated" so they will no longer hatch.
- Tempered Zombies - stronger zombies with nastier effects!
- Tempered Boomer: Glows in the dark, full of mutant blood and when it explodes it can infect units on death as a random zombie.
- Tempered Spitter: Has an arcing acid attack
- Flesher: Skinless, fast, horrifying
- Tempered Fat Zombie: When enough damage is done or when downed a flesher will emerge from inside if not using Incendiary or Anti-E115
- Tempered Infector: Can infect just like an infector but also carries 6 parasites that can randomly detach each turn, every time you damage him he's guaranteed to release one more the next turn. Will drop all of them on death/stun if not using Incendiary or Anti-E115
- True Chryssalids - WIP Lore: The chryssalids you face are genetically enhanced and designed to be war machines, somehow the original chryssalids have managed to escape one of their containing facilities and spread throughout the galaxy. These original chryssalids are smarter but have a slower life cycle that leaves them susceptible, the queen is also rumored to posess Psionic abilities.
- Badass Chryssalid Brood Mother: carries eggs containing larvae, when struck one of them will drop, on death if not using incendiary or Anti-E115 she will drop all of them. Additiionally she can shoot  3 eggs and then regenerate one every 5 to 10 turns.
- Badass Chryssalid Spitter: Has a nasty non archiing aoe acid attack, explodes on death.
- Chryssalid Larva: A small and fast unit with low HP but high camo, can infect humans and other creatures.
- Chryssalid & Badass Chryssalid eggs: chance to pop out a larva each turn. Badass chryssalid eggs will spawn a whole "Badass" class chryssalid but kill the host (Egg sacs die without releasing any other eggs after releasing these eggs)
- Egg Sac: When a brood mother shoots its eggs they're all bundled together and will erupt one at a time once per turn, using Anti-E115 or Incendiary damage automatically unrpimes all of the eggs. Contains 1 Badass egg and 5 Regular eggs. Regular eggs will hatch with priority, meaning the badass egg is either the last or second last.
